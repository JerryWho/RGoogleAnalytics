{"name":"Rgoogleanalytics","tagline":"R Library to easily extract data from the Google Analytics API into R","body":"\r\nThis repo is the new home for the RGoogleAnalytics library migrated from [Google Code SVN](https://code.google.com/p/r-google-analytics/)\r\n\r\n## What is it\r\n\r\nRGoogleAnalytics is a R Wrapper around the [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) API. It allows fast and easy data extraction in R so that further statistical analysis can be run on the data\r\n\r\n## Key Features\r\n\r\n* Provides Access to v3 of the [Google Analytics Core Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/)\r\n\r\n* Ability to **pull more than 10,000 rows of data** in batches via **pagination** of queries\r\n\r\n* Ability to **mitigate the effect of Query Sampling** by splitting the date-range of queries and hence extract (nearly) unsampled data\r\n\r\n* Supports authorization via OAuth 2.0\r\n  \r\n* In cases where queries are sampled, the output also returns the percentage of sessions that were used for the query\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo get the current released version from CRAN:\r\n\r\n```R\r\ninstall.packages(\"RGoogleAnalytics\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the current development version from github:\r\n\r\n```R\r\n# require(devtools)\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"Tatvic/RGoogleAnalytics\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) handles the underlying OAuth2.0 Authorization flow and the API requests\r\n\r\n* [lubridate](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html) handles the date manipulation logic underlying Query Partitioning\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nWork on RGoogleAnalytics was started by Michael Pearmain at Google. He was supported by Nick Mihailowski (Google) and Vignesh Prajapati (Tatvic). \r\n\r\n## Tutorials and Use-cases\r\n\r\nUnder development\r\n\r\n## Important Links\r\n\r\n* [List](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets) of Valid Dimension/Metric Combinations from the Google Analytics API Reference Guide\r\n\r\n* [Query Feed Explorer](http://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/explorer/) allows you to test your queries for syntatical correctness. Once verified, the query parameters can then be copied to your R Script\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
